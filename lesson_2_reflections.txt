How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area != working directory: You can have files in working direcory you don't want to add to your commit, so you don't include them in the staging area.
Staging area != repository: You can add files to the staging area even if it is not a right time to do a commit. you can add all the files you want to the staging area and then commit them together.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By adding files to the staging area one ata time.
