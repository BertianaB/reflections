When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- To share it with others (show to them or work with them)
- To have access to it from different machines
- To have a backup

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork -> I want to work on something someone else created, but without it modifying their work (because i have no permission or because i don't want to)
Clone -> I need to work on my computer on something, eg code
Branches -> I need to try something new (maybe more than one at a time), but at the same time have a working version of my code
